Description: library to apply JSON patches - Python 2.x
 Python-json-patch is a Python module (a library) to apply JSON Patches
 according to the IETF draft specification.
 .
 From the IETF site:
 .
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the
 exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
 .
 This format is also potentially useful in other cases when it's necessary to
 make partial updates to a JSON document.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.
